test_2_mend.sdf and test_14_mend.sdf contain molblocks from mainlib.sdf, an SDF
file from NIST. The actual mass spectra data has been removed from these SDF
files, and replaced with fake data.

test_14_record.gz is a TFRecord with features 'molecule weight', 'atom weights',
'circular_fp_1024', 'dense_mass_spec'

NB : Since 2 molecules will not pass the filters in get_sdf_to_mol, there will
only be 12 molecules into the TFRecord file.
